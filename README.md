# Modern Personal Portfolio

A sleek, professional, and fully responsive portfolio website for a Frontend Developer. This project focuses on semantic HTML structure, clean CSS layouts using Flexbox, and a seamless user experience across all devices.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: Uses CSS Media Queries to transition from a 3-column desktop layout to a single-column mobile stack.
- **Flexbox Layout**: Efficiently handles alignment for the navigation bar, project grid, and teacher reviews.
- **Clean Typography**: Features Google Fonts (Lobster) for a distinct brand identity.
- **Project Showcase**: A dedicated section for web projects with hover effects and structured lists.
- **Testimonials Section**: Styled review cards with rounded borders and professional formatting.
- **SEO Optimized**: Includes meta tags for descriptions, keywords, and Open Graph (OG) social sharing.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`) for better accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS3**: Advanced Flexbox techniques, Media Queries, and CSS transitions.
- **Google Fonts**: Integrated "Lobster" font for headings.

## 📱 Mobile-First Approach
The website is optimized for:
- **Desktops**: Large spacing and side-by-side sections.
